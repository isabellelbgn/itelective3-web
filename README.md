## Attendance Monitoring System
An attendance monitoring system to increase administrative and employee productivity. This reliable system replaces conventional paper-based attendance sheets and saves time while reducing administrative labor and maintaining the accuracy of the employees' attendance records.

The administration can only access this attendance monitoring system through the administration management subsystem to prohibit modification of attendance data by employees. However, employees are permitted to view their attendance data.
The administration can add, modify, and delete attendance data for existing employees and also add new employees to the system.

The following are the subsystems of the Attendance Monitoring System:
1. Employee Login
2. Employee Management Subsystem
3. Administration Management Subsystem
